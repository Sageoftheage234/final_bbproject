When the call of nature beckons and hunger strikes, no one wants to be faced with the undaunting task of figuring out where to eat. Working through the logistics of satisfying one's hunger is difficult. As modern day Hunter Gatherers this can be further complicated when you have a various palettes to satisfy; i.e. a family.</br></br>
